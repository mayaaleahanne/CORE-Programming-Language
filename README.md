## Project Features
This repository consists of a tokenizer, a parser, and an interpreter for the CORE programming language. In addition, garbage collection of variables is simulated in the terminal enviromment when the output of a syntatically proper CORE program is printed to the terminal. Also, the code creates a simulation of a callstack.

# Directions
1. Locate file named "Main.java" and run it
2. Enter the file path that contains your CORE program (Test cases for valid CORE programs can be found in the test cases folder)
3. Enter the file path that contains the values you want to read into the program (The file you'll want to run will be found in the test cases folder and will be named "input")
4. Observe program output
